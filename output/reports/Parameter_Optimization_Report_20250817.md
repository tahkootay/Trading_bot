# SOL/USDT Trading Bot - Parameter Optimization Report

**Date:** August 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Previous Issue:** No trades executed due to overly restrictive signal criteria

---

## 🎯 Optimization Summary

The trading bot parameters have been successfully optimized to address the issue of zero trades being executed during the 7-day analysis period. The original strategy was too conservative for real market conditions.

## 📊 Parameter Changes Applied

### 1. Signal Generator Code Optimizations
| Parameter | Previous Value | New Value | Change |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| ML Confidence Threshold | 15% | **8%** | -47% |
| Volume Ratio Requirement | 1.0x | **0.6x** | -40% |
| ADX Minimum | 20.0 | **15.0** | -25% |
| Signal Interval | 30 min | **15 min** | -50% |

### 2. Configuration File Updates (default.yaml)
| Parameter | Previous Value | New Value | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Default Filters** | | | |
| ADX Min | 25 | **15** | More inclusive trending |
| Volume Min (zvol_min) | 0.5 | **0.3** | Lower volume barrier |
| RSI Range | [35, 65] | **[25, 75]** | Wider market conditions |
| ML Margin Min | 0.15 | **0.08** | Lower ML threshold |
| ML Confidence Min | 0.70 | **0.60** | More opportunities |
| ML Agreement Min | 0.60 | **0.50** | Less restrictive ensemble |

### 3. Market Regime Adaptations
| Regime | Parameter | Old Value | New Value |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Trending** | ADX Min | 25 | **20** |
| **Trending** | Volume Min | 0.4 | **0.3** |
| **Trending** | RSI Range | [30, 70] | **[25, 75]** |
| **Ranging** | ADX Min | 15 | **10** |
| **Ranging** | Volume Min | 0.6 | **0.4** |

## 📈 Validation Results

✅ **Parameter verification completed**  
✅ **Configuration syntax validated**  
✅ **Code optimization confirmed**  
✅ **Type safety maintained**

### Key Metrics Addressed:
- **Previous**: 0 trades in 7 days (too restrictive)
